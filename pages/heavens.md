Safety is traditionally regarded as one of the most important attributes in the automotive industry. At the same time, security has hardly been addressed, but new generation of vehicles will communicate much more with each other and with their environment.
However, security and safety are tightly connected, and security threats against vehicles could potentially affect the safety of the human being involved.

A modern vehicle contains 50-100 internal computers, ECUs, connected to an internal network. In this project, we identify security vulnerabilities in automotive systems and define methodologies along with tools for performing software security testing. We work with the design of the internal architecture of vehicles to make sure it can reliably operate in a hostile environment.
