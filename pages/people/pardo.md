My research is focused on enforcing privacy properties in big data systems, in particular social networks, by using formal methods. Currently, I am looking into the possibility of using knowledge-based logic for modeling deontic and epistemic properties of the system. This logic enables the possibility of definning more expressive privacy settings and also provides developers with tools to formally verify that the private information of the users is protected. I am under supervision of Gerardo Schneider and David Sands.
