The overall aim of the proposed research program is to develop a framework for design of information security solutions, based on identification of challenges encountered and produced by IS solutions in organizations of increasing socio-technical complexity and mobility.

The specific aims are to:

* Evaluate how threats emerging from access to new technologies, such as the Internet and wireless devices, affect technical solutions and current and future security work in organizations.

* Investigate how information security issues are dealt with during the design process and balanced against usability requirements.

Start of project: 2012

End of project: 2017
