  title: "Computer Network Security"
  url: 'network security'
  text: 'Why is it possible to break into networked applications and computer systems? What weaknesses are used? And what makes one protocol more secure than another? This course answers these questions and many more. We look at weaknesses that have plagued wired and wireless networked systems for years and investigate the security of countermeasures like firewalls and security protocols such as SSL, SSH and IPsec. Knowledge about possible threats and countermeasures is important for understanding what level of security a system and an application can offer. '

# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

permalink: /index.html

# This is a nasty hack to make the navigation highlight
# this page as active in the topbar navigation
