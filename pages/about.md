## Chalmers University of Technology
Chalmers University of Technology in Goteborg conducts research and
education in science, engineering, architecture,
technology management and economics, and nautical science in close
collaboration with industry
and society. Chalmers is one of Sweden's largest technological
universities, with about 10,600 students
and some 2,200 employees. The annual turnover is 2,300 MSEK, two thirds
of which relates to research
and research education, to a large extent at the international
forefront. Chalmers is a non-governmental
university with contracts with the Swedish Ministry of Education and is
owned by the Chalmers University
of Technology Foundation. This identity and a strong management give the
resources, flexibility, determination
and power to act in accordance with the vision: Chalmers - for a
sustainable future.
Chalmers is involved in approximately 140 industrial and educational
projects within the EU programmes.
## The Security group at Chalmers
The expertise of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
ranges from mathematical logic to applied industrial work in cooperation
with with large global companies. It combines scientific and engineering
approaches aiming at developing dependable and secure ICT systems.
The Security group has developed the link between three areas of
computer science: programming languages, computer security and
dependable computing. The group explores security models and enforcement
mechanisms based on programming-language technology. It has been
researching security modelling and metrication since the early 90ies and
  security issues for the "connected car", such as Secure Software
Download, for the last few years, together with Volvo Car Cooperation
and Volvo Trucks. Another major focus area is intrusion and fraud
detection. A large amount of the research during the last decade has
been conducted within the Security Arena at Lindholmen Science Park.
Here we work according to the Triple Helix model with a user perspective
and participation from  industry, academia and society.
